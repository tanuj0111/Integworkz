# Integworkz

Bliss static website packaged into the `Integworkz` repository. This project contains a simple HTML/CSS/JS template (named "Bliss") suitable for landing pages and small websites.

**Contents**
- `index.html` — Main landing page
- `assets/` — CSS, JS, fonts and images used by the template

**Quick start (view locally)**
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Or serve the folder with a simple static server, for example using Python 3:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

**Recommended next steps**
- Replace placeholder images in `assets/img` with your own.
- Update text in `index.html` for your brand and links.
- Add a `README.md` to the `Bliss-1.0.0/` subfolder if you plan to keep the original template preserved.

**License & credits**
This repository is built from the freely-distributed "Bliss" template. Keep any original credits if required by the template license.

If you'd like, I can also:
- Improve this README with usage examples and screenshots.
- Create a lightweight `package.json` and dev server for local development.
- Prepare a release tag and GitHub Release notes.
